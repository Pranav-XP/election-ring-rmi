## Authors

This repository contains two different implementations of a distributed election algorithm using the Ring topology and Java RMI. Each implementation resides in its own directory and has a dedicated `README.md` file to explain the details, setup, unit tests and usage instructions for that specific version.

## Project Structure

1. **Election Ring Without Peer Register**  
   A simple implementation where each node is manually linked to its next node in the ring.

2. **Election Ring With Peer Register**  
   An advanced implementation where nodes register themselves with a `PeerRegister`, which manages the ring structure and node linkage dynamically.
